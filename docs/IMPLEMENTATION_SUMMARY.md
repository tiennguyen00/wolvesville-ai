# Wolvesville Webapp Implementation Summary

## Project Structure

We've set up a robust backend structure for the Wolvesville webapp following modern practices:

```
server/
├── config/             # Configuration files
│   ├── db.js           # Database configuration (PostgreSQL)
│   └── mock-db.js      # Mock database for demonstration
├── middleware/         # Express middleware
│   └── auth.js         # Authentication middleware (JWT)
├── routes/             # API routes
│   ├── userRoutes.js   # User authentication and profile routes
│   ├── gameRoutes.js   # Game session and management routes
│   └── chatRoutes.js   # Chat and messaging routes
├── socket/             # Socket.io handlers
│   ├── gameSocketHandlers.js   # Real-time game events
│   └── chatSocketHandlers.js   # Real-time chat messaging
├── scripts/            # Utility scripts
